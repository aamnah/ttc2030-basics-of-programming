"""
5.1.
Create new source file 'utils.py'.
Implement function show_info, which prints into the console "I'm Utils.Info"
Create another new source file 'tester.py', where you call function `show_info`. Verify that output of the show_info is printed to the console.
"""

"""
5.2.
Add function subtract into the 'utils.py' file. subtract function takes two parameters and should return a subtraction of the given two parameters.
Add another function average into the 'utils.py' file. average function takes three parametes and should return average of the given parameters in precision of one decimal place.
Test these new functions with varying parameters and verify that they return correct values.
"""


"""
5.3.
Add function calc_consumption into the 'utils.py' file. calc_consumption takes parameters:

Vehicle fuel consumption as liters per 100km
Cost of fuel per liter
Traveled distance in kilometres.

The calc_consumption function prints to the console how many liters of fuel have been used on the way, as well as the amount of money spent on fuel.
Create a file 'consumption.py' asking the user: consumption, fuel price and distance traveled. Then call the calc_consumption function from the program. Check that the function calculates consumption and fuel price correctly.

Example output:

  Enter trip length in km: 150
  Enter fuel price/liter: 1.67
  Enter fuel consumption/100 km: 4.2
  Fuel consumed: 6.30 liter
  Cost: 10.52 â‚¬
