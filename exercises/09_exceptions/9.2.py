9.2.
Make a program to try to read all the files on the root of the hard disk C on a Windows machine (on macOS/Linux/Unix machines try to read the user's root directory). View files on the console. Then try adding the file 'ayho.txt' to the root of C (on macOS/Linux/Unix to the user's root directory).
What happened? Repair the program so that it does not crash.

Bonus Question: With what permissions could you add files on macOS/Linux/Unix machines to the root directory? Reply as a comment to the source code.
