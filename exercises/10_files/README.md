# Basics of Programming

## Exercises 10: Files

### 10.1.
Make a program that asks the user for the last names of the people and write the names given by the user to a file (you can decide the termination condition yourself).
Then open the file for reading and print the contents of the file line by line to the console.
Be aware of any exceptions that may be caused by handling the file.

### 10.2.
Using an editor (such as Notepad), create a text file '*names.txt*' to which you add at least ten women's and ten men's first names.
Make a program that reads the names from the above text file and tells you how many names can be found and how many times each name occurs. Sort the names alphabetically before printing.
Also note any other exceptions that may be caused by handling the file.

### 10.3.
Make a program that asks the user for numbers (either an integer or a floating point number) and save the integers in a different file than the floating point numbers.
The application should be terminated if the user does not enter an integer or a floating point number.
Use a text editor to check the contents of the files.
